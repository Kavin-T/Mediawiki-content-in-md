## Overview

This website is a replication of the Tamil Wiki, specifically tailored for the Venmurasu Programming Contest. We've harnessed the power of Hugo and the Book-Master theme to bring you an immersive and visually appealing experience.

## Hugo Themes Repository

The themes used in this project are sourced from the official Hugo Themes repository. You can explore and find more themes at [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/).

# Run the PHP script for conversion
php convert.php input.xml output.md
```
